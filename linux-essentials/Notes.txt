gzip file # will create a file.gz and will erase the original file.

gzip -d file.gz # unzip/deflate/decompress the given file. After decompression erase the given .gz file

gunzip file.gz # unzip/deflate/decompress the given file. After decompression erase the given .gz file

gzip -1 | -2 ... -9 # compression level -1 fast and less effective, -9 slow but with best compression. -6 is the default

gzip -c # compresses the file and print the compressed data to the terminal

--------------------------------

# BZip2 support only one file. After compressing delete the original file. After decompression delete the original .bz2 file

bzip2, bunzip2
bzip2 -d
bzip -1...-9 # the number is the amount of memory used to compress/decompress

find . # relative, shows relative output path
find /home # absolute, shows absolute output path

find -name "log*"
find -name "*log*"
find -name "*log-2016-05-[0-9][0-9].txt"
find -type d -name anyName # find directories
find -type f -name anyName # find files

find -atime # access time, date of last access
find -mtime # modification time, date of last modification

find -inum inodeNumber # find files or references that points to the given inode
find -name firstName -name secondName # find things with both firstname and secondName
find -name firstName -o -name secondName # find things with firstname or secondName. -o flag means logical "OR"


find \( -name "*log*" -o -name "*2016*" \) -a -name "*7*" # multiples or (-o) and logical and (-a) can be used and the precedence can be given with parenthesis . !!!!! IMPORTANT, the parenthesis must be escaped otherwise it will be interpreted by bash

find -name "*log*" ! -name "*111*" # the logical negation ! can also be used here

By default the action when there is a match is "-print" to print the matching paths. To execute a command on each matching path is -exec

find -name "*log*" -exec ls -l "{}" ";"
find -name "*log*" -exec ls -l \{\} \;

--------------------------------

zip loja.zip bemvindo.html contato.html # compress and archive. zip do not remove source files after compression

unzip loja.zip # decompress files, the original .zip files is not removed

unzip -l loja.zip # list files in the given file, withtout decompress it

zip loja.zip * # will add to a zip file everything from current directory. Standard behavior IS NOT RECURSIVE ( do not enter in directories )

zip -r loja.zip * # will add to a zip file everything from current directory RECURSIVELY (-r)

zip -v # Verbose

unzip -q # quite, do not output

unzip -d /tmp/target/ loja.zip # -d option to specify where to unzip

unzip loja.zip file1 file2 # specify which files from loja.zip are meant to be unziped

unzip loja.zip "file{1,2}" # unzip accept gobbling shell patterns


## Extension is not necessary, zip will add .zip automatically

find . -name "*.html" | zip -@ loja.zip # -@ is a signal to zip to understand that the result form a previous command should be used as file source list 

--------------------------------

wc fileName # count number of lines, words and bytes of the given file
wc -L fileName # get the number of characters in the largest line in the given file

more fileName # display the content of the file in the screen
<space> go to next page
b backward a page
<Enter> forward by one line
q quit 
v open current file in vi for edition
/ <term> search for term in the current file
n goes to next occurrence of <term> in the search
! run an external command

less fileName # display the content of the file in the screen
it has the same options as more and additional options
? backward search
N n goes to previuos occurrence of <term> in the search

--------------------------------

cat # concatenate files and print to the standard output
cat file1 file2 file3
cat -n # show line numbers

--------------------------------

head # print first 10 line from a given file. If more files are given the a header containing the file name is printed
head file1 file2

--------------------------------

tail # print last 10 lines from a given file. If more files are given then a header containing the file name is printed

--------------------------------

I/O redirects

standard input  : channel 0
standard output : channel 1
standard error  : channel 2

--- OUTPUT/ERROR
> redirects the standard output of a command 
>> redirects and append the standard output of a command 
2> redirects the standard error of a command 
2>> redirects and append the standard error of a command 

it is possible to redirect on stream to another

2>&1 redirects standard error to standard output


!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
cat /1234 2>&1 > outputfile.txt # redirect stderr to stdout ( terminal ) and stdout to a file. This will print the error to terminal

cat /1234 > outputfile.txt 2>&1 # redirect stdout to a file and stderr to stdout ( file ). This will print the error to a file

--- INPUT
< redirects standard input

find -name "log" -name "2016" > files_to_compress.txt
zip -@ logs < files_to_compress.txt # redirects stdin to a file, i.e., will read the content of the given file and redirects the stream of bytes to what zip command is reading

--- PIPE
Redirects standard output of a command to standard input of another, | (pipe) is used


find . -name "*log*" | zip -@ logs | wc -l


--------------------------------

cut - remove sections from each line of files

cut -c 1,5 fileName # get first and fifth char from file
cut -c 1-5 fileName # get from first until fifth char from file

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
cut index start with 1

## below commands have the same output
cut -c 1-4,14-20 --output-delimiter=";" notafiscal.posicional 
cut -c 14-20,1-4 --output-delimiter=";" notafiscal.posicional 


cut -d: -f 1,5 --output-delimiter="%" /etc/passwd ## -d delimiter , -f field number


--------------------------------

paste - merge lines of files

paste file1 file2 # combine line by line the given files, by default use tab as delimiter

paste -d: file1 file2 # -d to se custom delimiter

paste -s file1 file2 # output first file in a line, then second file in a new line (serial)


--------------------------------

sort - sort lines of text files
## take into account the language configured in the system in the following order $LC_ALL then $LC_COLLATE then $LANG. If none of these variable exists then sort uses ascii values of chars

# by default sort uses the whole line in the sorting process

cut -d: -f 1 /etc/passwd | sort

cut -c 1-4,5-13,14-21 --output-delimiter=":" notafiscal.posicional | sort -k 3 -t : -n -r -u -o output.file.name
# -t set delimiter.
# -k choose field based in its number, necessary separator or uses blank as default separator. 
# -n numeric sorting
# -r reverse order
# -u removes duplicated entries (unique)
# -o write the result to an output file


--------------------------------

grep - print lines that match patterns

grep pattern fileName # search for pattern in file and print matching lines
grep -n pattern fileName # show line number
grep -c pattern fileName # count number of matching lines
grep -i pattern fileName # ignore case
grep -l pattern fileName # file name only

--------------------------------

echo "Current folder `pwd`"  # execute command and replace its result in place
echo "Current folder $(pwd)" # execute command and replace its result in place
