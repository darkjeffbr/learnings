# Design Patterns
Is nice to know who people have solved problems and made their solutions available to the world.

## Lesson learned / Notes

### OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations

### OO Patterns
- **Stategy** : defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
